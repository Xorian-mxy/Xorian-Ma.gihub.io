## Day4 Do python exercises
# 1. Read 10 integers into a list and print their average, rounded to two decimal places.  
# 2. Given a list, print the second-largest value (assume no duplicates).  
# 3. Given a list, move every negative number to the front while keeping the relative order of the remaining elements—in place, no extra list.  
# 4. Read a string and use a list-comprehension to output all consonants (anything except a, e, i, o, u).  
# 5. Read a sentence, count how many times each word occurs, and print the counts in descending order (use a dictionary).  
# 6. Write a function `is_prime(n)` that returns `True`/`False`; then, in the main program, read an integer `x` and print every prime ≤ x.  
# 7. Write a function `find_duplicate(lst)` that returns the first element to appear twice; return `None` if no duplicates exist.  
# 8. Write a function `safe_divide(a, b)` that catches any exception and either returns the result of `a / b` or an informative error string.  
# 9. Write a function `list_stats(lst)` that returns a dictionary `{'sum': …, 'avg': …, 'max': …, 'min': …}`.  
# 10. Read two strings `s` and `t` and output the length of their longest common substring (contiguous, length ≤ 100; brute-force is fine).
